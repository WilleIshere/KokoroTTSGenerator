HOW TO RUN KOKORO TTS GENERATOR ON LINUX

1. If you received a ZIP file, extract it to a folder of your choice.

2. Make the AppImage executable:
   Open a terminal in the folder where you extracted the file and run:
   chmod +x KokoroTTSGenerator.AppImage

3. Run the application:
   - Double-click the "KokoroTTSGenerator.AppImage" file in your file manager
     OR
   - Run the following command in your terminal:
     ./KokoroTTSGenerator.AppImage

4. On first launch, the app will open in your default web browser. It may take a few minutes to set up the TTS models—please be patient.

5. Enter your text, select a voice, adjust speed and pitch as desired, then click "Generate" to create speech audio.

Tips:
- All processing is local—no internet is required after the first run.
- If the app does not launch, ensure you have permissions to run AppImages and that your system supports FUSE/AppImage.
- For troubleshooting, run the AppImage from the terminal to view any error messages.
