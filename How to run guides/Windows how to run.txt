HOW TO RUN KOKORO TTS GENERATOR ON WINDOWS

1. Extract the ZIP file you received to a folder of your choice.

2. Open the extracted folder and double-click on "KokoroTTSGenerator.exe" to start the application.

3. On first launch, the app will open in your default web browser. It may take a few minutes to set up the TTS models—please be patient.

4. Enter your text, select a voice, adjust speed and pitch as desired, then click "Generate" to create speech audio.

Tips:
- If you see a Windows Defender SmartScreen warning, click "More info" and then "Run anyway" to proceed.
- All processing is local—no internet is required after the first run.
- For best results, keep all files from the ZIP in the same folder.
- If you encounter issues, try running the app as Administrator (right-click > "Run as administrator").

Thank you for using Kokoro TTS Generator!
