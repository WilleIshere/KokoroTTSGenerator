HOW TO RUN KOKORO TTS GENERATOR ON MACOS

1. If you received a ZIP file, double-click it to extract the "KokoroTTSGenerator.app" application.

2. Move "KokoroTTSGenerator.app" to your Applications folder (recommended for best compatibility).

3. Open the application by double-clicking it in your Applications folder.
   - On first launch, you may see a security warning ("cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer").
   - To bypass this, right-click (or Control-click) the app and select "Open", then confirm in the dialog.

4. The app will open in your default web browser. On first launch, it may take a few minutes to set up the TTS models—please be patient.

5. Enter your text, select a voice, adjust speed and pitch as desired, then click "Generate" to create speech audio.

Tips:
- All processing is local—no internet is required after the first run.
- If you see a message about the app being damaged or not trusted, check your macOS security settings under System Preferences > Security & Privacy.
- For best results, keep the app in the Applications folder.

Thank you for using Kokoro TTS Generator!
